Voxel
==========
Voxel is a voxel (cube) based game that was inspired by such games as Minecraft and just basic engineering. Voxel is a open sandbox game written in Java and LWJGL to create a fully functional, multi platform game. The whole idea and plan for Voxel is to create a game where the user can create vast worlds from their imagination and also have fun with the more productive side of Voxel which is the machanical aspect of power.

Idea
==========
The idea is as stated to create a fun game for the user to enjoy and through an expanding world this is possible and also I thought what could make the already excisting game more fun then I though power.
From power the possibilities can be endless from machines that will terraform to more basic such as jetpacks and pipes. To balence most of this out, the stuff will not be given to you easy. Yes you can play the creative aspect and build a cool manshion to destroy later or explore the world looking for rare ores that will help build such machines to destroy anything that comes across you be it animal or creation.
